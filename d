You will zig zag your way through the crates and boxes and go left.At the end of the roof is a power line, you will go down it, and it crosses with another line at the end that you’ll fall onto. The 2nd piece of bread is in the middle of this 2nd line. "

Head across the power lines, and take the next 2 lines. You will land on a flower bed, and go around the roof to the left. There is a long power line here, with a piece of bread. Getting on the line can be tricky. You will now meet up with Route 1 and 3."

You will roll along the power lines and into a long gutter, which takes you along to a sloped roof that drops you onto a flower bed. There is a check point here. Take the next wires to the bread piece.

Zigzag through the crates after you land on the next roof, and turn right. Be careful, there is no railing to keep you from falling. There will be powerlines on the next roof."
